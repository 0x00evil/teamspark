          <h2>What is Teamspark?</h2>

<p>Teamspark is a clean and simple project/task management tool. It enables <strong>everyone</strong> within the team to capture inspiration, manage tasks, track the progress and communicate freely.</p>

<h2>Why Teamspark?</h2>

<p>I've been looking for a right team collaboration system. Email is an inefficient communication tool for us, especially when there are lots of files shared back and forth. IM is good to some extend, but it is hard to trace back. Before building teamspark, we use <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> a lot for project management and bug tracking. But it is a little bit complicate. We tried to force the entire team to use Redmine for communication and collaboration but it turned out that non techies dislike it.</p>

<p>Other than Redmine, I've used several other projects for collaboration:</p>

<ol>
<li>bugzilla/trac. Too geek, not the right choice for non engineers.</li>
<li>wikimedia. Not a right choice.</li>
<li>confulence: My favorite wiki system but neither open source nor free.</li>
<li>jive: Too complicated and not free.</li>
<li>asana: A great, modern collaboration tool. But too slow to access in China. :(</li>
<li>teambition: A collaboration tool, seems great on sharing information but not collaborating on tasks.</li>
</ol><p>As there seems no free and good tools, I decided to build my own.</p>

<h2>What on earth team spark can help?</h2>

<p>Teamspark could help to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Record every piece of information related with your project. Teamspark allow people to discuss and share ideas within the team freely. Including but not limited to: Ideas, Bugs, Tasks, Features, Improvements.</li>
<li>Make everyone in the team could know everything about the projects within the team.</li>
<li>Enable realtime collaboration.</li>
</ol><h2>What is the current status of teamspark?</h2>

<p>Teamspark is still a very young project. But it is usable now. In <a href="http://tukeq.com">tukequan</a>, we've been using is for over 2 months and more than 1000 sparks were created and processed. So if your team is as small as us (less than 20 people), please have a try.</p>
